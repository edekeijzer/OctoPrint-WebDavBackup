# WebDAV Backup

This plugin will automatically upload a backup upon completion to your WebDAV storage, like Nextcloud.

## Prerequisites

### OctoPrint version
At this moment you will need to install OctoPrint from git because the current release does not yet have event support in the backup plugin.

### WebDAV storage
You need a working WebDAV storage solution to upload your back-ups to. I have tested this against Nextcloud 17.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/edekeijzer/OctoPrint-WebDavBackup/archive/master.zip

## To-Do
- [X] ~~Develop this plugin~~
- [X] ~~Customizable filenames~~
- [X] ~~Create folders per year and/or month~~
- [ ] Improve error handling, display messages in UI
